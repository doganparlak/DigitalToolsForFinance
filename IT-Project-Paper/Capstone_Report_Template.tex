\begin{abstract}
	   Currently we are living in an era,where inflation became a major problem for global and local economies. In this paper, we have investigated the relationship between global inflation and commodity prices and checked whether commodity prices grow faster than global inflation. We used representation techniques which we learned in the class and we found out that even though there is a strong correlation between them, we couldn't conclude that all commodity prices grow faster than inflation. It depends on both time period and commodity. In certain periods inflation grow faster than certain commodities and vice versa.

\section{Introduction}

Commodity prices were always one of the main determinants of the global inflation price. Hence, it is always important to understand their relationship between inflation. In this paper, we investigated the relationship between commodity prices and inflation and we found out that even though most of time they move together, there is no clear evidence that they grow faster than inflation. There are times at which some commodity prices grows faster than certain commodity prices. However, this is not case always and trend can be changed i.e. inflation grows faster than them. So we can say that some commodity prices grow faster than global inflation in some time periods.

\section{Data}
 We collected prices for the following commodities in order to approximate price changes in important categories : barley, beef, cocoa, orange, sugar(food prices), natural gas and oil (energy prices) and gold (metal prices). We used data from World Bank. Since G20 countries which constitutes more than 80 percent of World GDP, we decided to use G20 inflation rate to approximate global inflation. We used data from OECD in order to calculate global inflation rate. All our data is from 2018-05 until 2021-08 in monthly time interval
\section{Methodology}
 We transformed our data by using percentage change. Since commodity prices are in nominal values seeing percentage changes will allow us to compare it to global inflation. Afterwards, we plotted all commodities against inflation and compared with each other in order to see possible relationship between them. 




\section{Results and Discussion}

In this section we will present our tables and figures in order to support our result that it is not always the case that commodity prices rise faster than global inflation.

\subsection{Percentage Change Graphs}
In this section we are going to display percentage changes of previously selected commodity prices. then we are going to compare them with global inflation rate.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Discussion}
From the previous graphs we can see that not all commodity prices increase faster than inflation rate. Clearly there is a strong positive correlation between most of the commodity prices and inflation however, from figure 18 we can see that not all commodity prices increase faster than inflation even if they increase faster inflation for some time period it is not true for all time interval we consider. Another example is that from figure 15, we can clearly see that crude oil price didn't increase faster than inflation until 2020-04. After that point, even though it increased faster than inflation until 2020-06, it decreased rapidly afterwards. So we can't conclude that it increase faster than G20 inflation.

\section{Conclusion}

In summary, from our previous analysis we saw that inflation and commodity prices rise and decline in a positively correlated way. However, not all commodity prices increase faster than inflation and overall since commodity prices increase faster than inflation only at some short time intervals and it is not persistent, we can't conclude our statement "Do commodity prices grow faster than global
inflation?"is true.
