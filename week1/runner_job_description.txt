while true; do echo -n "hello" ; sleep 122400; done

Assuming the runner.sh file is first executed exactly at 00:00, the code segment above will print hello at every second day at 17:00. 60 x 60 x 24 = 61200 which can be used to print hello everyday. For every second day, we simply do 61200 x 2 = 122400. The while true statement keeps the program run forever. Sleep command is used to keep track of seconds and echo is used to print the message.
