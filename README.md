Research Topic:

-Do commodity prices grow faster than global inflation? <br />

We will find a dataset which inherits the relation between commodity prices and global inflation. Storing the data in the database we have created, we are planning to generate as many plots which are supported with numerical findings in tables. The visualization standards will obey the ones discussed in class. Ashort paper will be written including all of the results in corresponding sections. The interactive app will be used to clearly demonstrate the growth of commodity prices and global inflation and it will be fairly easy for user to make the comparison. Most importantly, our project will be reproduceble and the findings could be easily obtained from scratch.
