- Research Topic:

 Do commodity prices grow faster than global inflation? <br />

- Short Description: <br />

  Currently, we are living in an era where inflation becomes a major problem for the global and local economies. One of the main drivers of current inflation wave are commodity prices like oil and gas. We are using a dataset which inherits the growth pace of commodity prices and global inflation. Storing the data in the database we have created, we are planning to generate as many plots which are supported with numerical findings in tables. The visualization standards will obey the ones discussed in class. A short paper will be written including all of the results of the corresponding sections. The interactive app will be used to clearly demonstrate the growth of commodity prices and global inflation and it will be fairly easy for user to make the comparison. Most importantly, our project will be reproducable and the findings can be easily obtained from scratch.
